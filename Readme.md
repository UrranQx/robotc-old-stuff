This repo is just an archive of my old RobotC programms that I wrote while I was learning robotics.

I've encountered different but really basic problems at that point. And I barely knew any of the following:
C Syntax, algorithms, data structures (even arrays were a mystery). So I just to write code which will compile and sometimes solves my problem.

So these basics promlems are:
- KegelRing where you need to move all cans out of the black ring
- KegelRing Macro where you cant touch black cans
- Line follower with 1/2/3/4 Sensors (3 and more Sensors were used for pretty narrow line)
- Line follower with crossings (where you should stop at the 5-th crossing or you need to stop at the red crossng etc.)
- Slalom (robot should follow the line and go around the obstacles)
- Balancer (robot should balance on two weels which really looks like standing "standing" and it needs to follow the line, do Slalom at some point and go up and down the hill)
- Inverse Line follower 1/2 Sensors
- Wall follower (Robot should go alongside the wall with given distance between)
- Maze Solver where you can run right hand algorirthm
- Speed Racer where robot is moving in path (which looks like really distorted loop), the path is surrounded by walls and there is small obstacles on the path and finally there is a 3 perpendicular black lines which represent finish/start position and you need to count your loops via these lines because if you don't stop after the particular loop -> You'll lose.
- Small tennis game
- Football game with Infra Red ball and special sensor to catch the signal from the ball
